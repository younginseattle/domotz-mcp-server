# Domotz MCP Server - API Skill

## Architecture

This MCP server consolidates **133 Domotz API actions** into **10 category tools**. Instead of 130+ flat tool definitions, each category tool uses an `action` parameter for routing to the correct endpoint.

**How it works:**

1. Every tool call requires an `action` string (e.g., `"list"`, `"get"`, `"status_history"`)
2. The generic dispatcher (`lib/registry.js`) looks up the action in the category's action map
3. URL path parameters like `{agent_id}` are replaced from your arguments
4. Query parameters, request bodies, and HTTP method are all derived from the action definition

**Key insight:** You never specify HTTP methods or URLs. Just pick the right tool, set the `action`, and provide the required parameters.

## Quick Reference: The 10 Tools

| Tool | Actions | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `domotz_agents` | 31 | Collectors: list, status, uptime, VPN, variables, topology |
| `domotz_devices` | 17 | Devices: list, get, edit, status history, RTD, connect |
| `domotz_monitoring` | 13 | SNMP/TCP sensors (Eyes): create, delete, history, triggers |
| `domotz_alerts` | 8 | Alert profiles: list, bind/unbind to agents and devices |
| `domotz_network` | 14 | Scan policies, interfaces, routed networks, excluded devices |
| `domotz_configuration` | 8 | Config backups, credentials, SNMP authentication |
| `domotz_power` | 7 | Power actions, outlets, attach/detach devices |
| `domotz_drivers` | 8 | Custom drivers: associations, execute actions |
| `domotz_inventory` | 19 | Custom fields, tags, device profiles, device types |
| `domotz_account` | 5 | User info, API usage, areas, teams |

**3 composite tools** are also available — `domotz_get_device_full_status`, `domotz_get_agent_overview`, and `domotz_search_devices` — each combining multiple API calls into one. All 3 carry `readOnlyHint: true` and are safe to call without side effects.

## Important Gotchas

1. **`outlet_action` vs `action`**: The `trigger_outlet` action in `domotz_power` uses a parameter called `outlet_action` (not `action`) to specify what the outlet should do. The `action` param is always the tool's operation selector.

2. **HEAD requests return counts**: Actions like `count`, `count_variables`, `count_applications` use HTTP HEAD. The response is `{ "count": N }` extracted from the `X-Entities-Count` header. These are lightweight and don't transfer response bodies.

3. **`hasBody` actions need `body` param**: Any action marked with `hasBody: true` expects a `body` object. If you omit it, an empty `{}` is sent. Check the Domotz API docs for the required body schema.

4. **DELETE returns `{ success, status }`**: Delete operations don't return the deleted resource. They return `{ "success": true, "status": 204 }`.

5. **`field` param in devices and power**: The `edit` action on devices and the `power_action` action both use a `field` URL parameter. For device edits, this is the field name to update (e.g., `"importance"`, `"details"`). For power actions, it identifies the specific power action to execute.

6. **Pagination defaults**: Most list endpoints return all results if `page_size` is not specified. Use pagination for large result sets to avoid timeouts.

7. **Time parameters**: `from` and `to` accept ISO 8601 timestamps. Most default to the last 7 days if omitted.

8. **`list_uptime_all` needs no agent_id**: This is the only agents action that works without specifying a collector.
